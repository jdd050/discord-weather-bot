# Discord Weather Bot
This is a discord bot that aims to alert users to any warnings, watches, and/or advisories issued by the U.S. National Weather Service.

# How It Works
This bot utilizes GitHub user Kelvin's [US-Cities-Database](https://github.com/kelvins/US-Cities-Database) and the National Weather Service's [public API](https://api.weather.gov/) to create discord embed messages with warning/watch/advisory info. I also have a local database on my machine that allows users in my friend group's server to define cities or states the bot should actively monitor for alerts.

# Developer Notes
This bot is under development, and may not recieve consistent updates. I am a college student doing this in my spare time.
